Source code and research related documents for [Sentence Semantic Similarity Using Dependency Parsing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8944671).

We are currently working on reformatting this repo into a library. Feel free to create a PR for current issues or raise a new one.

We're following [Google Style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for python developement with mandatory type annotations to get some well documented and nicely written code. Further standards and practices are to be decided and open for suggestions.
